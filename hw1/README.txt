Random file could be generated by using util\generator.py using syntax:
generator.py	random_input random_update random_lookup

Indexing on primary key of table
python main.py -d database.dat --create -i input.txt
Running with input file composed of ~100,000 pairs of words took around 3s
python main.py -d database.dat --update -i update.txt
Running with update file composed of ~30,000 pairs of words took around 190s
python main.py -d database.dat --lookup -i lookup.txt
Running with lookup file composed of ~30,000 pairs of words (and words) took around 3s

Without indexing on primary key, inserting took only 2s, but updating and looking up took like forever so I didn't report the completion time.
